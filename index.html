      <h2>Footprints</h2>
      <p>One night I dreamed a dream.<br>
        As I was walking along the beach with my Lord.<br>
        Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life.<br>
        For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,<br>
        One belonging to me and one to my Lord.</p>
        
        <p>After the last scene of my life flashed before me,<br>
          I looked back at the footprints in the sand.<br>
          I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,<br>
          especially at the very lowest and saddest times,<br>
          there was only one set of footprints.</p>
        
        <p>This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it.<br>
          "Lord, you said once I decided to follow you,<br>
          You'd walk with me all the way.<br>
          But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life,<br>
          there was only one set of footprints.<br>
          I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me."</p>
        
        <p>He whispered, "My precious child, I love you and will never leave you<br>
          Never, ever, during your trials and testings.<br>
          When you saw only one set of footprints,<br>
          It was then that I carried you."</p>
